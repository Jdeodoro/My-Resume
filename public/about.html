    <h1>So, this is me...</h1>
    <p>
        If you cared to come so far, I think I might have done something right to get your attention, so I'm gonna tell you a little bit more about myself.

        When I was just a small boy, around 7 or 8, I discovered the swedish band "Roxette". I fell in love right there and then. And something that really bothered me back then was that I didn't know what they were singing about in their songs, even though I loved the melodies. I was just a brazilian kid who could barely speak Portuguese properly. That created inside me the urge to learn that language, that I didn't even know was called "English" by then.

        So I started imitating the way songs in english were sung, singing aloud, writing down what made sense to me (in a very brazilian way)... and that was filling me with new words and sounds every day. A few years later and I was getting better and better. Today I consider myself (I don't know if fluent is the best word to use here, but I'd say pretty good, thank you very much) in that language that I so dreamed of understanding 25 years ago, and here's the catch, that brought me so far when I think about technology...

        If I wanna know anything, if I wanna learn something new (and I wanna know lots of things - very curious), I just Google it and there are tons of video tutorials, and most of them are in English. So I've been learning about this new world of codes and programming languages and I'm loving it. It's not easy, far from that, but I can see myself happy in the future giving me the kudos if I don't give up, and if you wanna know a secret, I won't. So that's (more of) me!

        If you're wondering what I look like, here's a selfie:
